# Fractional-and-Volterra-processes

Empirical studies suggest that memory effects and strong intertemporal dependencies are prevalent in various financial and economic phenomena. Since Brownian motion assumes independent increments, it is not well-suited for capturing such dependencies. In this course, we focus on Volterra stochastic processes, an extension of standard Brownian motion that incorporates memory, with fractional Brownian motion as a notable special case.

We developed the necessary mathematical tools to handle these non-standard Volterra integral equations, which extend beyond the conventional framework of stochastic calculus for Markov processes and semimartingales.

Furthermore, we explored the modeling advantages of these equations by integrating memory into various financial applications. This approach broadens the scope of stochastic modeling in finance, providing more realistic representations of memory effects in asset prices, volatility, and market dynamics.
